## üîê Notes

- **Password fields** are stored as hashed values for security.
- Images are referenced as filenames, implying integration with a file system or image hosting.
- Admin and user login is separated to maintain different access levels.
- All tables use `utf8mb4` encoding for better multilingual support.
